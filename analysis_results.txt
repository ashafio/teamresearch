=== STATISTICAL HYPOTHESIS TESTING ===

Research Question:
Do reviews that mention staff/service receive higher star ratings
than reviews that do not?

Hypothesis 1 (Means):
H0: μ(service mention) = μ(no service mention)
H1: μ(service mention) ≠ μ(no service mention)
Test: Welch's two-sample t-test
Significance level: α = 0.05

-------------------------------------------

	Welch Two Sample t-test

data:  Rating_num by mentions_service
t = -9.6781, df = 9495.7, p-value < 2.2e-16
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group FALSE and group TRUE is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -0.3443644 -0.2283635
sample estimates:
mean in group FALSE  mean in group TRUE 
           3.478805            3.765169 


Effect Size (Cohen's d): 0.194 
Magnitude: 1 

Decision on H0 (means): REJECT H0 (p < 0.05)
Conclusion: Service-mention reviews have significantly different ratings.
Mean difference: 0.286 stars

Hypothesis 2 (Proportions):
H0: p(5-star | service) = p(5-star | no service)
H1: p(5-star | service) ≠ p(5-star | no service)
Test: Pearson's chi-squared test
Significance level: α = 0.05

-------------------------------------------

	Pearson's Chi-squared test with Yates' continuity correction

data:  contingency_table
X-squared = 47.056, df = 1, p-value = 6.899e-12


5-star proportion (service mention): 42.36 %
5-star proportion (no service mention): 35.58 %
Difference: 6.78 percentage points

Decision on H0 (proportions): REJECT H0 (p < 0.05)
Conclusion: 5-star proportion is significantly higher when service is mentioned.

=== EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS: AMBIENCE MENTION ===

Ambience mention t-test:
Mean (ambience mentioned): 3.991 
Mean (no ambience mention): 3.442 
p-value: <0.001 
Result: Ambience mentions also associate with significantly higher ratings.

=== RESULTS SUMMARY ===
-------------------------------------------
1. MEANS TEST (Welch's t-test):
   Service-mention reviews: mean = 3.765 
   No service mention: mean = 3.479 
   t-statistic: -9.68 
   p-value: <0.001 
   Effect size (Cohen's d): 0.194 
   Decision: REJECT H0

2. PROPORTIONS TEST (Chi-squared):
   5-star % (service): 42.36 %
   5-star % (no service): 35.58 %
   χ² statistic: 47.06 
   p-value: <0.001 
   Decision: REJECT H0

3. EXPLORATORY (Ambience):
   Mean (ambience): 3.991 
   Mean (no ambience): 3.442 
   p-value: <0.001 

=== INTERPRETATION ===
Service-mention reviews receive significantly higher star ratings.
Both mean ratings and 5-star proportions are higher when service is mentioned.
Ambience mentions show a similar positive association (exploratory finding).

=== MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS ===
Restaurants should prioritize service quality training and staffing to
protect their online rating profiles. Service mentions in reviews are
associated with higher ratings, suggesting that attentive, courteous staff
positively influence customer satisfaction and rating outcomes.
